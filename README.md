MVC Portable Database
=======================

A solution containing 2 preconfigured portable databases: SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) and SQLite. 

The solution portraits the following concepts:
 - How to structure your solution to alternate data sources in runtime.
 - Portable database alternatives (showcase, benefits and limitations).
 - How to configure your solution to use SQL Server Compact and/or SQLite.

This code was used to write [this post](http://codedwell.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/sql-server-compact-vs-sqlite/) 
on my [blog](http://codedwell.wordpress.com/).

TODO:
 - Fix task editing.

Note:
The code that manages SQLite was not authored by me. Please visit the [System.Data.SQLite](http://system.data.sqlite.org/) website for more information.
