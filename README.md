Portable database example
=======================

A solution containing 2 preconfigured portable databases: SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) and SQLite.
Here you will find an example on how to configure MVC to work with said databases.

This code was used to write [http://codedwell.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/sql-server-compact-vs-sqlite/](this post) 
on my [http://codedwell.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/sql-server-compact-vs-sqlite/](blog).

TODO:
 - Develop webpages that let the user view the data in both databases (scaffold).

Note:
The code that manages SQLite was not authored by me. Please visit the [http://system.data.sqlite.org/](System.Data.SQLite) website for more information.
