MVC Portable Database
=======================

A solution containing 2 preconfigured portable databases: SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) and SQLite.

Here you will find an example on how to configure MVC to work with said databases.

This code was used to write [this post](http://codedwell.wordpress.com/2013/08/18/sql-server-compact-vs-sqlite/) 
on my [blog](http://codedwell.wordpress.com/).

TODO:
 - Develop webpages that let the user view the data in both databases (scaffold).

Note:
The code that manages SQLite was not authored by me. Please visit the [System.Data.SQLite](http://system.data.sqlite.org/) website for more information.
